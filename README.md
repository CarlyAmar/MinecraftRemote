MinecraftLaunchSelector
=======================

I short Linux script to select from a list of Minecraft launchers.

The setup file needs to have sudo powers. This Script assumes that all of your launchers are in the same place.
It will work best if the launchers are the only thing in that folder.

You will have the option of deleting the setup file at the end of setup, if you delete it, you will have to re-download it again to use it.
When you are done, close Terminal and reopen it and you should be able to just type Minecraft and It will prompt you for which launcher.
ONLY WORKS IF YOU RESTART TERMINAL
